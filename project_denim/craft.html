                <h1>THE CRAFTSMANSHIP<br>AND MATERIALS</h1>
                <h2>THE STORY<br>BETWEEN THE THREADS</h2>
                <p class="body-copy">Denim is a fabric defined not just by its durability, but by the craftsmanship and meticulous attention to detail that goes into its creation. Traditionally woven from 100% cotton, denim is made using a twill weave, where the weft thread passes under two or more warp threads. This technique creates a subtle diagonal ribbing and adds strength to the fabric, making it both resilient and flexible. Indigo dye—historically derived from natural plant sources—has long been used to color the warp threads, while the weft threads are left undyed, giving denim its signature blue exterior and white underside. High-quality denim often begins with long-staple cotton, which yields stronger, smoother yarns and enhances both the feel and longevity of the final product.</p>

                    <h3>Craftsmanship</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Twill Weave:</strong> The diagonal pattern of denim is created by the twill weave, where the weft thread passes under at least two warp threads. This weave contributes to the fabric's strength and durability.</li>
                        <li><strong>Indigo Dyeing:</strong> The indigo dye is what gives denim its distinctive blue color. The dyeing process can be tailored to achieve different shades of blue.</li>
                        <li>Denim is primarily made from cotton, and the weaving process creates a durable and sturdy fabric that is commonly used in the production of jeans and other clothing items.</li>
                        <li>The craftsmanship of denim extends beyond the fabric itself. The sewing, stitching, and construction of denim garments, like jeans, also involve skilled craftsmanship.</li>
