                <h2>DENIM'S FASHION EVOLUTION<br>THROUGHOUT THE YEARS</h2>
                <p class="body-copy">Denim as a textile began as an ideal fabric for workwear at the start of the 20th century. It was regularly used for prison garb, naval uniforms, but perhaps most notably by the fortune hunters during the California Gold Rush. It was not until late 1873 that Levi Strauss Co. patented the original “blue jean”.  The style was eventually dubbed the 501 in 1890 and continues to be a classic in today’s fashion world. What made Levi’s jeans different was the copper rivets placed at different stress points to increase durability. The design has stood the test of time both physically and culturally. It is speculated that on any given day, more than half of the world’s population is wearing jeans.</p>

                <p class="body-copy">Denim began to take part in “lifestyle” genres of clothing: “western wear” and “play clothes”. Western wear emerged from the romanticization of cowboy films and the popularity of dude ranch vacations, while play clothes coincided with the leisure activities of playing tennis and beach days. The “all-in-one” denim jumpsuit also comes to mind when thinking about denim as the unofficial uniform of female factory workers during World War II and famously worn by Rosie the Riveter. The 1950s saw jeans at the center of controversy, where denim became associated with biker gangs and teenage unrest. By the 1960s, denim such as bell-bottom jeans, embroidered denim, and patched denim became established trends of the hippie counterculture movement. By the 1970s, these trends and the counterculture movement had reached the mainstream. The 1970s also saw a craze for Italian and French jeans by European companies like Fiorucci, with silhouettes so tight that wearers would have to lie down to zip them up. But it was Calvin Klein in the 1980s that created what were considered the first “designer jeans,” modeled and immortalized by Brooke Shields.</p>

            <p class="body-copy">Hip Hop’s influence on the popularity of denim in the 1990s was tremendous, and by the end of the decade, denim had become a true luxury item. Roberto Cavalli and Jean Paul Gaultier helped establish denim as high fashion by the start of the 2000s. The Japanese denim industry has seen tremendous growth over the past 30 years, with emphasis on authentic reproduction and vintage details. Contemporary designs play on fabrics to emulate the iconic look of the original blue jeans, such as leather looks from Bottega Veneta or denim leggings by Rag & Bone.</p>
